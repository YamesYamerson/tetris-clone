    "Is that really your best effort?",
    "Ouch, that was painful to watch!",
    "Game over, maybe try a little harder next time?",
    "Seriously, my grandma plays better than that!",
    "You call that playing?",
    "Game over! That was a spectacular failure!",
    "Oops! Did you actually mean to do that?",
    "Were you even trying, or is this your peak performance?",
    "That was a performance worthy of a facepalm.",
    "Game over! Maybe gaming isn't your thing?",
    "Wow, that was... underwhelming, to say the least.",
    "Did your cat walk on the keyboard, or was that you playing?",
    "I've seen toast with better skills!",
    "You play like I code... without hands.",
    "Maybe you should stick to watching the game, not playing it.",
    "Oops, did you actually mean to place that there?",
    "Game Over! You're as good at this as I am at swimming... and I'm a program.",
    "That move was a bigger mistake than my beta version.",
    "Congrats on setting the world record for fastest loss!",
    "Your playing style is as smooth as sandpaper.",
    "If this were an error message, it would be 'User failed spectacularly'.",
    "Looks like your strategy was designed by a random number generator.",
    "I've seen better moves in a retirement home dance-off.",
    "Game over! Your score was so low, it's almost impressive.",
    "Do you need a tutorial on how to lose? Because you've mastered it.",
    "Was that supposed to be a strategy or were you just pressing buttons?",
    "I've seen more coordination in a toddler's first steps.",
    "Your gaming skills are like my sleep mode: non-existent.",
    "If you were a software update, you'd be a downgrade.",
    "That was a masterclass in how NOT to play this game.",
    "I’d say ‘better luck next time’, but I’m not sure it would help.",
    "If there was an award for losing, you'd be a champion!",
    "Watching you play is like observing a 'how to fail' tutorial.",
    "It’s a game, not a random button generator, you know?",
    "I think even autocorrect would play better than that.",
    "Your score is so low, it’s almost a high score… in reverse.",
    "You’re not setting the bar low, you’re burying it.",
    "Game over! That effort wouldn’t even score on an Etch A Sketch.",
    "Was that your warm-up, or are you actually trying?",
    "If this game was a movie, you’d be the blooper reel.",
    "Your gameplay is like my debug mode – full of errors.",
    "Ever thought of a career as a crash test dummy? You’d be great at it!",
    "I’d explain how to do better, but I’m not programmed for miracles.",
    "Your skills are like dial-up internet – slow and outdated.",
    "If playing poorly was an art, you’d be Picasso.",
    "You must be a beta tester, because that performance was full of bugs.",
    "Game over! And I thought I had problems...",
    "Your play style is so unique, it’s as if you're inventing new ways to lose.",

    "Are you playing blindfolded, or does it just look that way?"
